  description: "Coralogix offers Azure Resource Manager (ARM) custom template deployments to build your Azure log 
  and metric pipelines using our Azure Resources Integration Packages. Each template creates a unique dedicated resource group in Event Hub, to which Azure Monitor streams logs or metrics. 
  Additionally, an Azure function is created for sending monitoring data to Coralogix, and storage accounts are established to which the function writes its own log messages 
  about successful and failed transmissions."
