  description: Coralogix allows you to monitor any status pages which share their RSS/Atom feed. Using alerts and visualizations you can gain insight into the status of incidents. Having both Statuspage and application/infrastructure logs consolidated within Coralogix allows you to view and analyze incident trends. This can help with root cause and impact analysis as well as in correlating resources with issues.
